A restaurant or vendor logs in to update menu items, mark ingredients out of stock, and view incoming orders from nearby theaters.

3. Delivery Driver – Pick Up and Deliver Orders
A driver checks the app for available deliveries, accepts one, and uses route info to deliver the food to the customer’s seat.

4. Theater Staff – Coordinate Deliveries
Staff monitor incoming orders, verify seat numbers, and ensure deliveries are routed efficiently inside the theater.

An admin reviews analytics, manages user roles, updates content, and ensures system uptime and data accuracy.

## How to download prepackaged release


## Troubleshooting

**Frontend Issues:**
- `npm run dev` fails → Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Port 3000 already in use → Use `npm run dev -- -p 3001` or kill existing process
- TypeScript errors → Check `next-env.d.ts` exists and restart VS Code

**Backend Issues:**
- Flask server won't start → Ensure Python dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Database connection errors → Verify MySQL is running and connection string is correct
- API endpoints return 404 → Check if backend server is running on port 5000

**Common Problems:**
- CORS errors → Ensure backend allows frontend origin (localhost:3000)
- Login/signup fails → Verify backend API endpoints are accessible
- Cart not persisting → Clear browser storage and refresh page
